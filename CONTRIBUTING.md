# Contributing

Please make sure your pull request follows these guidelines.

- **Make indivdual pull requests for every topic or code example you want to add.**
- Only make a pull request for complete code examples, topics, or reference items. If you have an idea or a suggestion, use [Issues](https://github.com/Brunozhon/SwiftReference/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/Brunozhon/SwiftReference/discussions/categories/ideas).
- Search previous pull requests before adding a new one &mdash; it may be a duplicate.
- New topics, improvements of code examples, etc. are welcome. Remenber, it's a reference, not a cheatsheet.
- Check your spelling. Test your code in Swift Playgrounds or a Swift Sandbox. Make sure to use Swift 5.3.

If you want to ask a question, use [Discussions](https://github.com/Brunozhon/SwiftReference/discussions/categories/q-a) too.
